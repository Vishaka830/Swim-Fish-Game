# Swim-Fish-Game
Swim Fish is a simple yet fun game developed with front-end technologies. The primary goal of this project was to increase understanding of the video game creation methods, communication behaviour and attitudes for the purpose of building more accurate models.  I have tried to use very simple concepts to make the game more attractive for user.
